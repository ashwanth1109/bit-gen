# React Component Generator

List your templates

```shell
bit templates
```

Output should contain:

```
ashwanth1109.looper/generators/react-comp@0.0.3
    react-story (Custom generator for react component)
    react-app (Custom generator for react app)
```

### Using your Generator

Use your generator to create the component files

```bash
bit create react-comp react-story
bit create react-comp react-app
```

### Using your Generator in other bit workspaces

Tag and export your generator component so you can use it in any other workspace. Make sure the scope name is set correctly in the `aspect.ts` file before tagging and exporting. Once you have tagged and exported the component you can add it to the `workspace.jsonc` file in the workspace where you want to use this generator.

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": ["my-scope-name/my-components"]
  }
}
```

Run `bit templates` to see your generator and then use it to generate you components.
